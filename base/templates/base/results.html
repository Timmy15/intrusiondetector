                    <p class="space-after">Intrusion attacks refer to unauthorized activities where malicious actors attempt to breach a computer system or network. The main aim is often to steal, alter, or destroy data, although sometimes the objective might be to simply cause disruption or scout for vulnerabilities for a future attack.</p>
                    <h3 class="space-after">Types of Intrusion Attacks:</h3>
                      <ol class="space-after">
                        <li>Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks: These attacks flood a system with excessive traffic or requests, rendering it unresponsive. A DDoS attack uses multiple systems to launch the attack, making it harder to counteract.</li>
                        <li>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: Here, the attacker intercepts the communication between two parties, potentially altering the messages before they reach their intended destination.</li>
                        <li>Phishing and Spear Phishing: These are deceptive techniques where attackers try to trick users into revealing personal information, usually through fake websites or emails.</li>
                        <li>Password Attack: This involves trying to decode a user's password to gain unauthorized access. Methods can include brute force, dictionary attacks, or keyloggers.</li>
                        <li>Drive-By Attack: This is when an attacker looks for an insecure website and plants a malicious script into one of its pages, which then runs on users' computers.</li>
                        <li>Malware and Ransomware: Malicious software or code that can damage or gain unauthorized access to systems. Ransomware, in particular, locks out users from their data until a ransom is paid.</li>
                      </ol>
                    <h3 class="space-after">How can you protect yourself?</h3>
                      <ol class="space-after">
                        <li>Firewalls: These act as barriers between trusted and untrusted networks, filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on predetermined policies.</li>
                        <li>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS): These monitor network traffic for suspicious activities and can take proactive measures to block or prevent malicious actions.</li>
                        <li>Regular Software Updates: Keeping software, including operating systems and applications, up-to-date ensures that you are protected against known vulnerabilities.</li>
                        <li>Educate and Train: Informing employees or users about the risks and signs of intrusion attacks can significantly reduce the chances of successful breaches.</li>
                        <li>Backup Data Regularly: Regular backups can prevent data loss in case of a successful intrusion attack.</li>
                        <li>Use Strong, Unique Passwords: Encourage the use of strong passwords and consider using a password manager to keep them safe.</li>
